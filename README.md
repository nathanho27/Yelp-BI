# Yelp-BI
Status: In Progress

Yelp-BI is a business intelligence project that uses real Yelp Fusion API data to build an interactive Power BI dashboard focused on business performance, pricing strategy, customer sentiment, and competitive market analysis. The goal is to transform location-based business data into actionable insights that would be valuable to business owners, market analysts, and strategic decision makers.

This project simulates a real-world analytics environment, moving from raw API data, through processing and modeling, to building dashboards that answer key business questions and generate strategic recommendations.
